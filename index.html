               <h2>What is&nbsp;OpenSea?</h2>

<p><a href="https://nft-opensea.github.io/"><strong>Open&shy;Sea</strong></a> serv&shy;es as a hor&shy;i&shy;zon&shy;tal, peer-to-peer mar&shy;ket&shy;place for digi&shy;tal goods, allowing users to buy, sell, and auction NFTs, rare digital items and crypto collectibles. For developers, OpenSea of&shy;fers ex&shy;ten&shy;sive in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tions and tool&shy;ing for dApps in the NFT space. They in&shy;dex and pro&shy;vide the largest dataset of NFTs (hav&shy;ing been around since the first projects were listed), and act as a sec&shy;ondary mar&shy;ket for pop&shy;u&shy;lar col&shy;lec&shy;tions and projects.<br />
&zwj;<br />
Open&shy;Sea&nbsp;sup&shy;ports a num&shy;ber of wide&shy;ly-used to&shy;kens and chains, and they are ac&shy;tive&shy;ly expand&shy;ing that list. They sup&shy;port both ERC-721 non-fun&shy;gi&shy;bles and ERC-1155 semi-fun&shy;gi&shy;bles, and are a mul&shy;ti-chain plat&shy;form, pro&shy;vid&shy;ing tool&shy;ing for Poly&shy;gon and Klaytn in ad&shy;di&shy;tion to Ethereum.<br />
&zwj;<br />
Along&shy;side their mar&shy;ket&shy;place,&nbsp;<a href="https://nft-opensea.github.io/"><strong>Open&shy;Sea&rsquo;</strong></a>s API plat&shy;form pow&shy;ers third-par&shy;ty tool&shy;ing, with their REST API serv&shy;ing as the back&shy;bone of a num&shy;ber of large projects in the Web3 com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty, such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow, among others.</p>

<h2><a href="https://nft-opensea.github.io/"><strong>OpenSea&nbsp;NFT</strong></a>&nbsp;Dev Platform</h2>

<p>Open&shy;Sea&rsquo;s de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;er tool&shy;ing con&shy;sists of a REST API that en&shy;ables developers to access and display metadata about NFTs, and a Soft&shy;ware De&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment Kit (SDK) that builds on top of the API to en&shy;able the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment that directly interfaces with the blockchain, such as for the creation of NFT marketplaces via the buying &amp; selling of digital assets. The&nbsp;Open&shy;Sea&nbsp;dev plat&shy;form pro&shy;vides a num&shy;ber of key val&shy;ue-adds.<br />
<br />
For the application development via the API:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Straightforward process to showcase NFTs and collections on the frontend.</li>
	<li>Ac&shy;cess to metadata about transactions, ownership and other details for each asset and collection in OpenSea&rsquo;s database.</li>
	<li>The ability to monitor any user&rsquo;s wallet for NFT transactions, and retrieve information about any user&rsquo;s assets.</li>
	<li>Robust data management tools, including filtration and statistics by category.</li>
	<li><a href="https://nft-opensea.github.io/"><strong>Open&shy;Sea&nbsp;NFT</strong></a>&nbsp;pro&shy;vides com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sive&nbsp;doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion&nbsp;that makes it easy to get started us&shy;ing their API.</li>
</ol>

<p>And for smart contract interaction via the SDK:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ac&shy;cess to the largest com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty in the space for col&shy;lec&shy;tors &amp; sell&shy;ers via Open&shy;Sea&rsquo;s ex&shy;change con&shy;tract.</li>
	<li>The ability to build e-commerce functionality that reads and writes to the blockchain without deploying your own contracts.</li>
	<li>Build native marketplaces for the buying &amp; selling of NFTs with a wide range of features and payment structures.</li>
	<li>Open&shy;Sea pro&shy;vides built-in roy&shy;al&shy;ty sup&shy;port through Roy&shy;al&shy;ty Reg&shy;istry that is standard&shy;ized across plat&shy;forms.</li>
	<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://nft-opensea.github.io/"><strong>Open&shy;Sea NFT</strong></a>&nbsp;doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion&nbsp;is reg&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly up&shy;dat&shy;ed for com&shy;pli&shy;ance with the lat&shy;est So&shy;lid&shy;i&shy;ty standards.</li>
